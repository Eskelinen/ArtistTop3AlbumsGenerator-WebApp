Here is a webApp that uses the LastFM API. The user gives the name of an artist and the API will search the top 3 most listened albums from them. The app then shows the album covers and tracklist, including song lengths.

All the album and artist data on the LastFM website is user generated, so this results in some problems. Very often albums will be missing tracklist info and covers, especially for lesser known artists. This can only be truly fixed by inputting the info into LastFM yourself. I've tried to make the website look nice even with this sometimes missing information.
One nice thing about the LastFM API is that it will correct small misspellings. For example, typing in 'acdc' will correct to 'AC/DC' and send back the right data.

No code here is directly copied from anywhere, but countless of Stackoverflow threads and W3schools articles were used as a source in making this app.
